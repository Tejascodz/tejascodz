The Pitch (short, loud, true)

I don’t just prototype — I ship functioning systems. From ADAS perceptual stacks to embedded IoT for structural health and automation for space-testbeds, I turn messy signals into reliable action. If it moves, I make it smart. If it's a problem, I make it solvable.

What I’ve Built (high-impact)

AI-Based Rough Terrain Rover — Autonomous rover (Jetson Nano) with SLAM, LiDAR + IMU + stereo fusion for real-time navigation (search & recon / disaster response focus).

Edge Impact Localization (SHM) — 4/6-sensor DAQ prototypes (ESP32-S3 / STM32 / RPi) using ToA/ToF + triangulation; 92% localization accuracy within 5 cm; ~90% cost reduction vs commercial piezo systems.

Gloves for Sign-Language Conversion — STM32 + 5 flex sensors + Bluetooth; <200 ms latency, 87% accuracy on custom dataset; Top-25 in AICTE Inventors Challenge (2,000+ teams).

ADAS MVP (AEB pipeline) — Infrastructure-based bird’s-eye camera stack: YOLO-based depth eval, velocity detection, TTC modeling; improved detection accuracy by 15%.

Automation for Spacechips UK — Python + SCPI/VISA test automation for signal generators & scopes; cut testing time by ~40%.

Honors & Recognition

1st Prize, ISRO & NSIL Startup Competition — national-level award for a space-tech startup concept.

Top 25 (India), AICTE Inventors Challenge — prototype for sign-language gloves (selected from ~2,000 teams).

Micro-mission statement

If it has a signal, I can control it. If it moves, I can make it think. 🔥
